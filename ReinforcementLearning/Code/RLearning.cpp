/******************************************************   You need to implement the two functions below   ***********************************************/


/* This function should return one of the four actions from "GO_EAST", "GO_WEST", "GO_NORTH", and "GO_SOURTH". The action should be generated based on the "COUNT" and "Q-values" for each of the four actions at the current state. Then choose the one with the maximum f() value: f(Q, N) = Q + K/N, where Q represents the current q value for action a; N is the count recorded for taking action a from current state. K is just a constant value. You can create any variables (or data members) as you need in this class (either in the "RLearning.h" file or "RLearning.cpp" file */

/* This function is similar to the function you implemented as last assignment for MDP. According to the input action and the current location "cur_loc", determine the next location of the variable. To make it easier, we assume if you take action north, you have 100% to land to the north as long as there is another square available in the north. Only if you are already in the North bounary or the square in the north is a wall, which is at the location (1, 1). After the next location is determined, you need to update the corresponding q value. Finally update the variable "cur_loc" by the new location coordinate */

    //Step 3 - update the new position: changing the value of variable "cur_loc"
